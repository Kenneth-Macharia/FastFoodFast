# The FastFoodFast Web App
## Introduction 
This repository hosts the development of an online app for FastFoodFast, a 5 star restaurant. Users will interact with the website frontend to order food for delivery.

## The Components
The app is made up of: 

    1.UI pages developed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaSript

    2.A RESTful API developed using the Python Flask, persisting to a PostgreSQL database

This branch contains the interactive pages development which can be viewed at the link below:

## Disclaimer
Development on this branch has ceased and is split out to two dedicated branches as follows:
    
    1.gh-pages - which will focus on the interactive front end development while making it possible to test the
    webpages while hosted on a remote server. (Github pages)
    
    2.heroku-api - which will focus on the API back improvements, while making it possible to test the API while
    hosted on a remote server. (Heroku)
